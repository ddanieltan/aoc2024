For example:\n0123\n1234\n8765\n9876\nBased on un-scorched scraps of the book, you determine that a good hiking trail is as long as possible and has an even, gradual, uphill slope. For all practical purposes, this means that a hiking trail is any path that starts at height 0, ends at height 9, and always increases by a height of exactly 1 at each step. Hiking trails never include diagonal steps - only up, down, left, or right (from the perspective of the map).\nYou look up from the map and notice that the reindeer has helpfully begun to construct a small pile of pencils, markers, rulers, compasses, stickers, and other equipment you might need to update the map with hiking trails.\nA trailhead is any position that starts one or more hiking trails - here, these positions will always have height 0. Assembling more fragments of pages, you establish that a trailhead’s score is the number of 9-height positions reachable from that trailhead via a hiking trail. In the above example, the single trailhead in the top left corner has a score of 1 because it can reach a single 9 (the one in the bottom left).\nThis trailhead has a score of 2:\n...0...\n...1...\n...2...\n6543456\n7.....7\n8.....8\n9.....9\n(The positions marked . are impassable tiles to simplify these examples; they do not appear on your actual topographic map.)\nThis trailhead has a score of 4 because every 9 is reachable via a hiking trail except the one immediately to the left of the trailhead:\n..90..9\n...1.98\n...2..7\n6543456\n765.987\n876....\n987....\nThis topographic map contains two trailheads; the trailhead at the top has a score of 1, while the trailhead at the bottom has a score of 2:\n10..9..\n2...8..\n3...7..\n4567654\n...8..3\n...9..2\n.....01\nHere’s a larger example:\n89010123\n78121874\n87430965\n96549874\n45678903\n32019012\n01329801\n10456732\nThis larger example has 9 trailheads. Considering the trailheads in reading order, they have scores of 5, 6, 5, 3, 1, 3, 5, 3, and 5. Adding these scores together, the sum of the scores of all trailheads is 36.\nThe reindeer gleefully carries over a protractor and adds it to the pile.

For example:\n….#….. ………# ………. ..#……. …….#.. ………. .#..^….. ……..#. #……… ……#…\nThe map shows the current position of the guard with ^ (to indicate the guard is currently facing up from the perspective of the map). Any obstructions - crates, desks, alchemical reactors, etc. - are shown as #.\nLab guards in 1518 follow a very strict patrol protocol which involves repeatedly following these steps:\nIf there is something directly in front of you, turn right 90 degrees. Otherwise, take a step forward. Following the above protocol, the guard moves up several times until she reaches an obstacle (in this case, a pile of failed suit prototypes):\n….#….. ….^….# ………. ..#……. …….#.. ………. .#…….. ……..#. #……… ……#…\nBecause there is now an obstacle in front of the guard, she turns right before continuing straight in her new facing direction:\n….#….. ……..&gt;# ………. ..#……. …….#.. ………. .#…….. ……..#. #……… ……#…\nReaching another obstacle (a spool of several very long polymers), she turns right again and continues downward:\n….#….. ………# ………. ..#……. …….#.. ………. .#……v. ……..#. #……… ……#…\nThis process continues for a while, but the guard eventually leaves the mapped area (after walking past a tank of universal solvent):\n….#….. ………# ………. ..#……. …….#.. ………. .#…….. ……..#. #……… ……#v..\nBy predicting the guard’s route, you can determine which specific positions in the lab will be in the patrol path. Including the guard’s starting position, the positions visited by the guard before leaving the area are marked with an X:\n….#….. ….XXXXX# ….X…X. ..#.X…X. ..XXXXX#X. ..X.X.X.X. .#XXXXXXX. .XXXXXXX#. #XXXXXXX.. ……#X..\nIn this example, the guard will visit 41 distinct positions on your map.\nPredict the path of the guard.

For example:\n2333133121414131402\nThe disk map uses a dense format to represent the layout of files and free space on the disk. The digits alternate between indicating the length of a file and the length of free space.\nSo, a disk map like 12345 would represent a one-block file, two blocks of free space, a three-block file, four blocks of free space, and then a five-block file. A disk map like 90909 would represent three nine-block files in a row (with no free space between them).\nEach file on disk also has an ID number based on the order of the files as they appear before they are rearranged, starting with ID 0. So, the disk map 12345 has three files: a one-block file with ID 0, a three-block file with ID 1, and a five-block file with ID 2. Using one character for each block where digits are the file ID and . is free space, the disk map 12345 represents these individual blocks:\n0..111....22222\nThe first example above, 2333133121414131402, represents these individual blocks:\n00...111...2...333.44.5555.6666.777.888899\nThe amphipod would like to move file blocks one at a time from the end of the disk to the leftmost free space block (until there are no gaps remaining between file blocks). For the disk map 12345, the process looks like this:\n0..111....22222\n02.111....2222.\n022111....222..\n0221112...22...\n02211122..2....\n022111222......\nThe first example requires a few more steps:\n00...111...2...333.44.5555.6666.777.888899\n009..111...2...333.44.5555.6666.777.88889.\n0099.111...2...333.44.5555.6666.777.8888..\n00998111...2...333.44.5555.6666.777.888...\n009981118..2...333.44.5555.6666.777.88....\n0099811188.2...333.44.5555.6666.777.8.....\n009981118882...333.44.5555.6666.777.......\n0099811188827..333.44.5555.6666.77........\n00998111888277.333.44.5555.6666.7.........\n009981118882777333.44.5555.6666...........\n009981118882777333644.5555.666............\n00998111888277733364465555.66.............\n0099811188827773336446555566..............\nThe final step of this file-compacting process is to update the filesystem checksum. To calculate the checksum, add up the result of multiplying each of these blocks’ position with the file ID number it contains. The leftmost block is in position 0. If a block contains free space, skip it instead.\nContinuing the first example, the first few blocks’ position multiplied by its file ID number are 0 * 0 = 0, 1 * 0 = 0, 2 * 9 = 18, 3 * 9 = 27, 4 * 8 = 32, and so on. In this example, the checksum is the sum of these, 1928.\nCompact the amphipod’s hard drive using the process he requested. What is the resulting filesystem checksum?

Every time you blink, the stones each simultaneously change according to the first applicable rule in this list:\n\nIf the stone is engraved with the number 0, it is replaced by a stone engraved with the number 1.\nIf the stone is engraved with a number that has an even number of digits, it is replaced by two stones. The left half of the digits are engraved on the new left stone, and the right half of the digits are engraved on the new right stone. (The new numbers don’t keep extra leading zeroes: 1000 would become stones 10 and 0.)\nIf none of the other rules apply, the stone is replaced by a new stone; the old stone’s number multiplied by 2024 is engraved on the new stone. No matter how the stones change, their order is preserved, and they stay on their perfectly straight line.\n\nHow will the stones evolve if you keep blinking at them? You take a note of the number engraved on each stone in the line (your puzzle input).\nIf you have an arrangement of five stones engraved with the numbers 0 1 10 99 999 and you blink once, the stones transform as follows:\n\nThe first stone, 0, becomes a stone marked 1.\nThe second stone, 1, is multiplied by 2024 to become 2024.\nThe third stone, 10, is split into a stone marked 1 followed by a stone marked 0.\nThe fourth stone, 99, is split into two stones marked 9.\nThe fifth stone, 999, is replaced by a stone marked 2021976.\n\nSo, after blinking once, your five stones would become an arrangement of seven stones engraved with the numbers 1 2024 1 0 9 9 2021976.\nHere is a longer example:\nInitial arrangement:\n125 17\n\nAfter 1 blink:\n253000 1 7\n\nAfter 2 blinks:\n253 0 2024 14168\n\nAfter 3 blinks:\n512072 1 20 24 28676032\n\nAfter 4 blinks:\n512 72 2024 2 0 2 4 2867 6032\n\nAfter 5 blinks:\n1036288 7 2 20 24 4048 1 4048 8096 28 67 60 32\n\nAfter 6 blinks:\n2097446912 14168 4048 2 0 2 4 40 48 2024 40 48 80 96 2 8 6 7 6 0 3 2\nIn this example, after blinking six times, you would have 22 stones.

Each antenna is tuned to a specific frequency indicated by a single lowercase letter, uppercase letter, or digit. You create a map (your puzzle input) of these antennas. For example:\n............\n........0...\n.....0......\n.......0....\n....0.......\n......A.....\n............\n............\n........A...\n.........A..\n............\n............\nThe signal only applies its nefarious effect at specific antinodes based on the resonant frequencies of the antennas. In particular, an antinode occurs at any point that is perfectly in line with two antennas of the same frequency - but only when one of the antennas is twice as far away as the other. This means that for any pair of antennas with the same frequency, there are two antinodes, one on either side of them.\nSo, for these two antennas with frequency a, they create the two antinodes marked with #:\n..........\n...#......\n..........\n....a.....\n..........\n.....a....\n..........\n......#...\n..........\n..........\nAdding a third antenna with the same frequency creates several more antinodes. It would ideally add four antinodes, but two are off the right side of the map, so instead it adds only two:\n..........\n...#......\n#.........\n....a.....\n........a.\n.....a....\n..#.......\n......#...\n..........\n..........\nAntennas with different frequencies don’t create antinodes; A and a count as different frequencies. However, antinodes can occur at locations that contain antennas. In this diagram, the lone antenna with frequency capital A creates no antinodes but has a lowercase-a-frequency antinode at its location:\n..........\n...#......\n#.........\n....a.....\n........a.\n.....a....\n..#.......\n......A...\n..........\n..........\nThe first example has antennas with two different frequencies, so the antinodes they create look like this, plus an antinode overlapping the topmost A-frequency antenna:\n......#....#\n...#....0...\n....#0....#.\n..#....0....\n....0....#..\n.#....A.....\n...#........\n#......#....\n........A...\n.........A..\n..........#.\n..........#.\nBecause the topmost A-frequency antenna overlaps with a 0-frequency antinode, there are 14 total unique locations that contain an antinode within the bounds of the map.\nCalculate the impact of the signal.

    "text": "Part 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPuzzle Info\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Elf has for you both the page ordering rules and the pages to produce in each update (your puzzle input), but can’t figure out whether each update has the pages in the right order.\nFor example:\n47|53\n97|13\n97|61\n97|47\n75|29\n61|13\n75|53\n29|13\n97|29\n53|29\n61|53\n97|53\n61|29\n47|13\n75|47\n97|75\n47|61\n75|61\n47|29\n75|13\n53|13\n\n75,47,61,53,29\n97,61,53,29,13\n75,29,13\n75,97,47,61,53\n61,13,29\n97,13,75,29,47\nThe first section specifies the page ordering rules, one per line. The first rule, 47|53, means that if an update includes both page number 47 and page number 53, then page number 47 must be printed at some point before page number 53. (47 doesn’t necessarily need to be immediately before 53; other pages are allowed to be between them.)\nThe second section specifies the page numbers of each update. Because most safety manuals are different, the pages needed in the updates are different too. The first update, 75,47,61,53,29, means that the update consists of page numbers 75, 47, 61, 53, and 29.\nTo get the printers going as soon as possible, start by identifying which updates are already in the right order.\nIn the above example, the first update (75,47,61,53,29) is in the right order:\n\n75 is correctly first because there are rules that put each other page after it: 75|47, 75|61, 75|53, and 75|29.\n47 is correctly second because 75 must be before it (75|47) and every other page must be after it according to 47|61, 47|53, and 47|29.\n61 is correctly in the middle because 75 and 47 are before it (75|61 and 47|61) and 53 and 29 are after it (61|53 and 61|29).\n53 is correctly fourth because it is before page number 29 (53|29).\n29 is the only page left and so is correctly last.\n\nBecause the first update does not include some page numbers, the ordering rules involving those missing page numbers are ignored.\nThe second and third updates are also in the correct order according to the rules. Like the first update, they also do not include every page number, and so only some of the ordering rules apply - within each update, the ordering rules that involve missing page numbers are not used.\nThe fourth update, 75,97,47,61,53, is not in the correct order: it would print 75 before 97, which violates the rule 97|75.\nThe fifth update, 61,13,29, is also not in the correct order, since it breaks the rule 29|13.\nThe last update, 97,13,75,29,47, is not in the correct order due to breaking several rules.\nFor some reason, the Elves also need to know the middle page number of each update being printed. Because you are currently only printing the correctly-ordered updates, you will need to find the middle page number of each correctly-ordered update. In the above example, the correctly-ordered updates are:\n75,47,61,53,29\n97,61,53,29,13\n75,29,13\nThese have middle page numbers of 61, 53, and 29 respectively. Adding these page numbers together gives 143.\n\n\n\n\neg = \"\"\"47|53\n97|13\n97|61\n97|47\n75|29\n61|13\n75|53\n29|13\n97|29\n53|29\n61|53\n97|53\n61|29\n47|13\n75|47\n97|75\n47|61\n75|61\n47|29\n75|13\n53|13\n\n75,47,61,53,29\n97,61,53,29,13\n75,29,13\n75,97,47,61,53\n61,13,29\n97,13,75,29,47\n\"\"\"\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef parse(inp:str) -&gt; tuple[dict, dict, list]:\n    top, bot = inp.split(\"\\n\\n\")\n\n    # Bad rules contain all the numbers (values) that cannot come on the left of (key)\n    bad_rules = defaultdict(list)\n    # Good rules contain all the numbers (values) that must come on the left of (key) - used in part2\n    good_rules = defaultdict(list)\n    for t in top.splitlines():\n        a,b = t.split(\"|\")\n        bad_rules[int(b)].append(int(a))\n        good_rules[int(a)].append(int(b))\n\n    lines = []\n    for b in bot.splitlines():\n        line = b.split(\",\")\n        line = [int(l) for l in line]\n        lines.append(line)\n\n    return bad_rules, good_rules, lines\n\ndef part1(inp:str) -&gt; int:\n    rules, _, lines = parse(inp)\n\n    correct = []\n    for line in lines:\n        is_valid = True\n        for i, num in enumerate(line):\n            to_the_right = line[i+1:]\n1            must_be_left = rules[num]\n            if any([x in to_the_right for x in must_be_left]):\n                is_valid = False\n                break\n\n        if is_valid:\n            correct.append(line)\n\n    # Assume all correct lists are an odd numbered length\n    medians = [line[len(line)//2] for line in correct]\n\n    return sum(medians)\n\npart1(eg)\n\n\n1\n\nUse [] to access values from a defaultdict, not .get()\n\n\n\n\n143\n\n\n\nwith open(\"inputs/05\", \"r\") as f:\n    inp = f.read()\n\npart1(inp)\n\n4185"

    "text": "Part 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPuzzle Info\n\n\n\n\n\nThere’s just one problem: by holding the two lists up side by side (your puzzle input), it quickly becomes clear that the lists aren’t very similar. Maybe you can help The Historians reconcile their lists?\nFor example:\n3   4\n4   3\n2   5\n1   3\n3   9\n3   3\nMaybe the lists are only off by a small amount! To find out, pair up the numbers and measure how far apart they are. Pair up the smallest number in the left list with the smallest number in the right list, then the second-smallest left number with the second-smallest right number, and so on.\nWithin each pair, figure out how far apart the two numbers are; you’ll need to add up all of those distances. For example, if you pair up a 3 from the left list with a 7 from the right list, the distance apart is 4; if you pair up a 9 with a 3, the distance apart is 6.\nIn the example list above, the pairs and distances would be as follows:\n\nThe smallest number in the left list is 1, and the smallest number in the right list is 3. The distance between them is 2.\nThe second-smallest number in the left list is 2, and the second-smallest number in the right list is another 3. The distance between them is 1.\nThe third-smallest number in both lists is 3, so the distance between them is 0.\nThe next numbers to pair up are 3 and 4, a distance of 1.\nThe fifth-smallest numbers in each list are 3 and 5, a distance of 2.\nFinally, the largest number in the left list is 4, while the largest number in the right list is 9; these are a distance 5 apart.\n\nTo find the total distance between the left list and the right list, add up the distances between all of the pairs you found. In the example above, this is 2 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 5, a total distance of 11!\nYour actual left and right lists contain many location IDs. What is the total distance between your lists?\n\n\n\n\neg = \"\"\"3   4\n4   3\n2   5\n1   3\n3   9\n3   3\n\"\"\"\n\ndef parse(inp:str) -&gt; tuple[list[int], list[int]]:\n    # Parse input into 2 lists\n    A = list()\n    B = list()\n    for line in inp.splitlines():\n        a, b = line.split()\n        A.append(int(a))\n        B.append(int(b))\n\n    # Sort and zip\n    A = sorted(A)\n    B = sorted(B)\n\n    return (A,B)\n\n\ndef part1(inp:str) -&gt; int:\n    A,B = parse(inp)\n    return sum([abs(a-b) for a,b in zip(A,B)])\n\n\npart1(eg)\n\n11\n\n\n\nwith open(\"inputs/01\",\"r\") as f:\n    inp = f.read()\npart1(inp)\n\n1646452"

Calculate a total similarity score by adding up each number in the left list after multiplying it by the number of times that number appears in the right list.\nFor these example lists, here is the process of finding the similarity score:\n\nThe first number in the left list is 3. It appears in the right list three times, so the similarity score increases by 3 * 3 = 9.\nThe second number in the left list is 4. It appears in the right list once, so the similarity score increases by 4 * 1 = 4.\nThe third number in the left list is 2. It does not appear in the right list, so the similarity score does not increase (2 * 0 = 0).\nThe fourth number, 1, also does not appear in the right list.\nThe fifth number, 3, appears in the right list three times; the similarity score increases by 9.\nThe last number, 3, appears in the right list three times; the similarity score again increases by 9.\n\nSo, for these example lists, the similarity score at the end of this process is 31 (9 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 9 + 9).\nOnce again consider your left and right lists.
