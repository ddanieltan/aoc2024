Each report is a list of numbers called levels that are separated by spaces. For example:\n7 6 4 2 1\n1 2 7 8 9\n9 7 6 2 1\n1 3 2 4 5\n8 6 4 4 1\n1 3 6 7 9\nThis example data contains six reports each containing five levels.\nThe engineers are trying to figure out which reports are safe. The Red-Nosed reactor safety systems can only tolerate levels that are either gradually increasing or gradually decreasing. So, a report only counts as safe if both of the following are true:\n\nThe levels are either all increasing or all decreasing.\nAny two adjacent levels differ by at least one and at most three.\n\nIn the example above, the reports can be found safe or unsafe by checking those rules:\n\n7 6 4 2 1: Safe because the levels are all decreasing by 1 or 2.\n1 2 7 8 9: Unsafe because 2 7 is an increase of 5.\n9 7 6 2 1: Unsafe because 6 2 is a decrease of 4.\n1 3 2 4 5: Unsafe because 1 3 is increasing but 3 2 is decreasing.\n8 6 4 4 1: Unsafe because 4 4 is neither an increase or a decrease.\n1 3 6 7 9: Safe because the levels are all increasing by 1, 2, or 3.\n\nSo, in this example, 2 reports are safe.\nAnalyze the unusual data from the engineers.

Maybe you can help The Historians reconcile their lists?\nFor example:\n3   4\n4   3\n2   5\n1   3\n3   9\n3   3\nMaybe the lists are only off by a small amount! To find out, pair up the numbers and measure how far apart they are. Pair up the smallest number in the left list with the smallest number in the right list, then the second-smallest left number with the second-smallest right number, and so on.\nWithin each pair, figure out how far apart the two numbers are; you’ll need to add up all of those distances. For example, if you pair up a 3 from the left list with a 7 from the right list, the distance apart is 4; if you pair up a 9 with a 3, the distance apart is 6.\nIn the example list above, the pairs and distances would be as follows:\n\nThe smallest number in the left list is 1, and the smallest number in the right list is 3. The distance between them is 2.\nThe second-smallest number in the left list is 2, and the second-smallest number in the right list is another 3. The distance between them is 1.\nThe third-smallest number in both lists is 3, so the distance between them is 0.\nThe next numbers to pair up are 3 and 4, a distance of 1.\nThe fifth-smallest numbers in each list are 3 and 5, a distance of 2.\nFinally, the largest number in the left list is 4, while the largest number in the right list is 9; these are a distance 5 apart.\n\nTo find the total distance between the left list and the right list, add up the distances between all of the pairs you found. In the example above, this is 2 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 5, a total distance of 11!\nYour actual left and right lists contain many location IDs. What is the total distance between your lists?\n\n\n\n\neg = \"\"\"3   4\n4   3\n2   5\n1   3\n3   9\n3   3\n\"\"\"\n\ndef parse(inp:str) -&gt; tuple[list[int], list[int]]:\n    # Parse input into 2 lists\n    A = list()\n    B = list()\n    for line in inp.splitlines():\n        a, b = line.split()\n        A.append(int(a))\n        B.append(int(b))\n\n    # Sort and zip\n    A = sorted(A)\n    B = sorted(B)\n\n    return (A,B)\n\n\ndef part1(inp:str) -&gt; int:\n    A,B = parse(inp)\n    return sum([abs(a-b) for a,b in zip(A,B)])\n\n\npart1(eg)\n\n11\n\n\n\nwith open(\"inputs/01\",\"r\") as f:\n    inp = f.read()\npart1(inp)\n\n1646452"

Calculate a total similarity score by adding up each number in the left list after multiplying it by the number of times that number appears in the right list.\nFor these example lists, here is the process of finding the similarity score:\n\nThe first number in the left list is 3. It appears in the right list three times, so the similarity score increases by 3 * 3 = 9.\nThe second number in the left list is 4. It appears in the right list once, so the similarity score increases by 4 * 1 = 4.\nThe third number in the left list is 2. It does not appear in the right list, so the similarity score does not increase (2 * 0 = 0).\nThe fourth number, 1, also does not appear in the right list.\nThe fifth number, 3, appears in the right list three times; the similarity score increases by 9.\nThe last number, 3, appears in the right list three times; the similarity score again increases by 9.\n\nSo, for these example lists, the similarity score at the end of this process is 31 (9 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 9 + 9).\nOnce again consider your left and right lists. What is their similarity score?\n\n\n\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef part2(inp:str):\n    A, B = parse(inp)\n    cnts = Counter(B)\n    calc = [a * cnts.get(a,0) for a in A]\n\n    return sum(calc)\n\npart2(eg)\n\n31\n\n\n\npart2(inp)\n\n23609874"
