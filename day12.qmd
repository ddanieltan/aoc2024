## Part 1

::: {.callout-note title="Puzzle Info" collapse="true"}
Each garden plot grows only a single type of plant and is indicated by a single letter on your map. When multiple garden plots are growing the same type of plant and are touching (horizontally or vertically), they form a region. For example:
```
AAAA
BBCD
BBCC
EEEC
```
This 4x4 arrangement includes garden plots growing five different types of plants (labeled A, B, C, D, and E), each grouped into their own region.

In order to accurately calculate the cost of the fence around a single region, you need to know that region's area and perimeter.

The area of a region is simply the number of garden plots the region contains. The above map's type A, B, and C plants are each in a region of area 4. The type E plants are in a region of area 3; the type D plants are in a region of area 1.

Each garden plot is a square and so has four sides. The perimeter of a region is the number of sides of garden plots in the region that do not touch another garden plot in the same region. The type A and C plants are each in a region with perimeter 10. The type B and E plants are each in a region with perimeter 8. The lone D plot forms its own region with perimeter 4.

Here's a larger example:
```
RRRRIICCFF
RRRRIICCCF
VVRRRCCFFF
VVRCCCJFFF
VVVVCJJCFE
VVIVCCJJEE
VVIIICJJEE
MIIIIIJJEE
MIIISIJEEE
MMMISSJEEE
```
It contains:

- A region of R plants with price 12 * 18 = 216.
- A region of I plants with price 4 * 8 = 32.
- A region of C plants with price 14 * 28 = 392.
- A region of F plants with price 10 * 18 = 180.
- A region of V plants with price 13 * 20 = 260.
- A region of J plants with price 11 * 20 = 220.
- A region of C plants with price 1 * 4 = 4.
- A region of E plants with price 13 * 18 = 234.
- A region of I plants with price 14 * 22 = 308.
- A region of M plants with price 5 * 12 = 60.
- A region of S plants with price 3 * 8 = 24.

So, it has a total price of 1930.

What is the total price of fencing all regions on your map?

1. That the count of corners = count of sides is the crucial observation that makes part 2 approachable.
2. Needed to get a pen and paper out to draw this relationship.
